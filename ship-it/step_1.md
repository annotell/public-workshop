# The Code
1. Download or `git clone` the repository https://github.com/annotell/public-workshops
Open a terminal and cd to the repository location and into the ship-it folder. From here we will run all our commands
    ```bash
    $ cd <path to repository>
    $ cd ship-it
    ```
1. We picked a simple responsive webpage from a template at [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/). Our code could really be any piece of code, but just to pick something where it's easy to see changes made, we went with a webpage. In the ship-it folder there's a folder called src and it contains our webpage. You will find an index.html containing our html code, an assets folder containing css, js, webfonts etc, and an images folder containing the default images on the page. If you want to replace any image on the webpage, this is the place to look. 

1. Take a look at the code in the browser; open the `file://<full-path-to-repo>/public-workshops/ship-it/src/index.html` in your browser and take a look around.
This is our example application that we will work with during this workshop.
