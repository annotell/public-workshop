# The Setup
Prerequisite to install the following tools in order to be able to attend the workshop:
- docker https://www.docker.com/get-started
- minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
    - Follow step 1 and step 2 here to make sure it's correctly set up
    - Finish by running `minikube stop`
- kubectl https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- vs code https://code.visualstudio.com/download (or your choice of code editor)

These tools will be used throughout the workshop and in order to not have to spend time on downloading it during the event, we wish everyone will take the time to make sure they have it installed before. 

If you're on Windows, make sure you have WSL 2 activated before installing all the tools.
